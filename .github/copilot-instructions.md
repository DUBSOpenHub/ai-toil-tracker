# GitHub Copilot Instructions — AI Toil Tracker

This file gives Copilot immediate context so every session starts productive, not confused.

---

## What This Repo Does

Zero-dependency, GitHub-native toil tracking system. Teams submit repetitive-work ("toil") ideas via GitHub Issue forms. A GitHub Actions workflow auto-scores each idea using `Frequency × Time × People + Bonuses`, applies labels, calls the GitHub Models API for automation suggestions, and posts a structured triage comment — all within 60 seconds of submission.

## Scoring Formula

```
Toil Score = (Frequency × Time × People) + Bonuses
```

Fibonacci scale (1/2/3/5/8) for each dimension. Bonus: +10 per checked factor (max +30).

**Priority tiers** (configured in `config.yml`):
- 🔴 Critical ≥ 40 → `high-impact` label
- 🟡 High ≥ 20 → `high-impact` label
- 🟢 Medium ≥ 10 → no priority label
- ⚪ Low < 10 → no priority label

## Hard Constraints — Never Violate

1. **Zero runtime dependencies** — bash + gh + jq + curl only (all pre-installed on ubuntu-latest)
2. **All `${{ }}` expressions in `env:` blocks** — never inline them in `run:` scripts (injection prevention)
3. **Actions pinned to SHA** — never use `@v4` tags; use full commit SHAs like `@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683`
4. **Fork-friendly** — no hardcoded org/repo names; always use `${{ github.repository }}`
5. **Single-source scoring** — scoring logic lives ONLY in `scripts/scoring.sh`; never duplicate it

---

## Making Changes

### Changing scoring thresholds
→ Edit `config.yml` only. Scripts use `${CRITICAL_THRESHOLD:-40}` style defaults.

### Changing scoring functions
1. Edit `scripts/scoring.sh`
2. Run `bash tests/test-scoring.sh` (must exit 0)
3. Update `docs/scoring-guide.md` to match

### Changing form fields
1. Add/modify field in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/toil-idea.yml`
2. Add `parse_field("New Heading Label", "$BODY")` call in `ai-triage.yml`
3. Add test case in `tests/test-parsing.sh` + fixture in `tests/fixtures/`

### Changing the AI model or prompt
→ `config.yml` → `ai.model` / `ai.max_tokens`
→ Prompt is in `ai-triage.yml` step "Get AI automation suggestion"
→ Keep few-shot examples — they improve output quality significantly

## Local Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
bash tests/test-scoring.sh
bash tests/test-parsing.sh

# Scoring self-test
bash scripts/scoring.sh --selftest

# Interactive testing
. ./scripts/scoring.sh && . ./scripts/parse-form.sh
BODY=$(cat tests/fixtures/high-priority-with-bonuses.txt)
calc_full_score "$BODY"
echo "Score: $TOIL_SCORE, Priority: $PRIORITY_TIER"

# Validate YAML
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config.yml'))"
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ai-triage.yml'))"
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **En-dash `–` vs ASCII hyphen `-`** — dropdown values use en-dash; `time_score()` and `people_score()` handle both via regex `'5.{0,3}15'` patterns. Don't switch to exact string matching.

2. **Multiline `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`** — use heredoc pattern:
   ```bash
   echo "myvar<<__EOF__"
   echo "$MULTILINE"
   echo "__EOF__"
   ```
   Never: `echo "myvar=$MULTILINE"` — breaks on newlines.

3. **JSON payload for PATCH** — always use `jq -n --rawfile body /tmp/file '{"body": $body}'`. Never interpolate comment text into JSON strings directly.

4. **`set -e` in sourced files** — `scoring.sh` and `parse-form.sh` do NOT set `set -e` because it propagates to the caller. Let the caller set its own error handling.

5. **Label names include emoji** — e.g., `🔴 multiple-times-daily`. These labels must exist in the target repo. New forks need a label setup step (documented in README).

## Security — Secure Future Initiative (SFI)

When working in this repository, always apply these security principles:

- **Never commit secrets** — API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings must never appear in code or config files. Use environment variables or secret managers.
- **Validate all inputs** — Treat user input, API responses, and file contents as untrusted. Sanitize before use.
- **Dependency awareness** — Flag outdated or vulnerable dependencies when encountered. Prefer pinned versions.
- **Least privilege** — Request only the minimum permissions needed. Avoid broad OAuth scopes or wildcard IAM policies.
- **Secure defaults** — Default to HTTPS, encrypted storage, and authenticated endpoints. Opt-in to less secure options, never opt-out of secure ones.

## Responsible AI (RAI)

When generating or modifying code, content, or configurations:

- **Transparency** — When AI-generated content is user-facing, make it clear that AI was involved. Do not impersonate humans.
- **Fairness** — Avoid generating content that stereotypes, excludes, or discriminates based on protected characteristics.
- **Human oversight** — Recommend human review for high-stakes outputs (financial calculations, access control, health-related content).
- **Privacy** — Do not log, store, or transmit personal data beyond what the feature explicitly requires. Minimize data collection.
- **Reliability** — Include error handling and fallback behavior. Do not let AI failures cascade into silent data corruption.

## Accessibility (CLI)

Terminal output must be accessible to all users:

- **No color-only indicators** — Always pair color with text symbols (✓/✗, PASS/FAIL). Support NO_COLOR and FORCE_COLOR environment variables.
- **Screen reader compatibility** — Use clear, linear output. Avoid excessive spinner animations or cursor repositioning that confuses screen readers.
- **Readable output** — Use consistent formatting, adequate spacing, and avoid walls of text. Support --quiet and --verbose flags.
